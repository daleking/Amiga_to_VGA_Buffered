# Amiga Buffered VGA Adaptor

This VGA buffered adaptor uses a SN74HCT08PWR to keep the size down (and stay true to the original Commodore design).  You will also need a DB23 female solder cup connector and a VGA PCB mount connector (and a capacitor).

This is a replacement for the original [390682-01](http://bboah.amiga-resistance.info/cgi-bin/showhardware_en.cgi?HARDID=733)

I don't know what the other chip in the [390682-03](http://bboah.amiga-resistance.info/download_photos/comm_vgaconv4.jpg) is, or what the diodes (protection?) are for either.  Apparently this version has a fix for video toasters, so assume that this repro will behave the same and not work with video toasters either.

The design is upside down so that there is minimal strain on the DB23 video connector.  The VGA cable lies close to flat on the table.  I didn't want the weight of the cable pulling down on the connector.

No warranty, although I have built one and tested on A4000, A2000 and A500.

This method is a lot easier than stripping wires and soldering the cups :)

If you are lazy, you can order PCBs from [dirtypcbs.com](http://dirtypcbs.com/store/designer/details/dalek/6137/amiga-to-vga-buffered-zip) and using that link I get a dollar woo!  If you are cheap just grab the gerber zip file and get them done wherever you like.
